# This is the US/English general help file for Open RTE's orcmsd.
#
[orcmsd:usage]
Usage: %s [OPTION]...
Start an Open RTE Daemon

%s
[orcmsd:environ]
Open RTE Daemon was unable to set 
 %s = %s
in the environment. Returned value %d instead of ORTE_SUCCESS.
[orcmsd:init-failure]
Open RTE was unable to initialize properly.  The error occured while
attempting to %s.  Returned value %d instead of ORTE_SUCCESS.

#
[orcmsd:cannot-bind]
A request was made to bind the Open RTE daemons to
a core that does not exist on this node:

  node:  %s
  cores: %s

The MCA param directing this behavior is orcmsd_daemon_cores.
Please correct the request and try again.
#
#
[orcmsd_init:startup:internal-failure]
It looks like orcmsd_init failed for some reason; your parallel process is
likely to abort.  There are many reasons that a parallel process can
fail during orcmsd_init; some of which are due to configuration or
environment problems.  This failure appears to be an internal failure;
here's some additional information:

  %s failed
  --> Returned value %s (%d) instead of ORTE_SUCCESS
#
#
[orcmsd:session:dir:prohibited]
The specified location for the temporary directories required by orcmsd
is on the list of prohibited locations:

Location given: %s
Prohibited locations: %s

If you believe this is in error, please contact your system administrator
to have the list of prohibited locations changed. Otherwise, please identify
a different location to be used (use -h to see the cmd line option), or
simply let the system pick a default location.
#
[orcmsd:session:dir:nopwname]
orcmsd was unable to obtain the username in order to create a path
for its required temporary directories.  This type of error is usually
caused by a transient failure of network-based authentication services
(e.g., LDAP or NIS failure due to network congestion), but can also be
an indication of system misconfiguration.

Please consult your system administrator about these issues and try
again.
#
[orcmsd_nidmap:too_many_nodes]
An error occurred while trying to pack the information about the job. More nodes
have been found than the %d expected. Please check your configuration files such
as the mapping.
#
[orcmsd_init:startup:num_daemons]
orcmsd was unable to determine the number of nodes in your allocation. We
are therefore assuming a very large number to ensure you receive proper error
messages.
